1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to create a 12 and 24 hour clock to meet internatinal standard ISO 8601 for Chada Tech.

2) What did you do particularly well?
I thought that typing the overall code was pretty easy once i got the hang of it since I had java from my past class stuck in my head. I followed my flow chart and pusedocode.

3) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I feel like there might have been another way i could have placed the 2 clocks side by side then printing them the way i did. IF there is the improvment would be that it would look more organized and a little easier to read.

4) Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I did have trouble moving from java to C++, honestly at first i thought that C++ was the more difficult the java but If i can get the hang of java then i knew i would grasp C++. while i was trying to code both of the clocks i tried to make then seperatly but even when using w3 schools (which is my favorite refernce when doing my projects so far) i couldnt figure it out so with trial and error I was finally able to print them side by side.

5) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I may need to go back to this project if I have to write a code that needs to output two items side by side as i needed a little help to complete this project. 

6) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
When reading the details that i need to include in my project I write down notes that may help me. Using those notes I write my flow chart and pusodecod that plans out how my code should follow. I tried to keep my code organized and my in comments makes it a little easier to navigate through.
